# abs

Returns the absolute value of the input parameter. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus of a real number x, denoted
|x|, is the non-negative value of x without regard to its sign. For example,
the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. 
The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.

## usage examples

```
abs(-2)
abs(5)
```

# and

Perform bitwise AND on two numbers. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

A bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary
representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the 
corresponding bits, which is equivalent to multiplying them. Thus, if both bits
in the compared position are 1, the bit in the resulting binary representation 
is 1 (1 × 1 = 1); otherwise, the result is 0 (1 × 0 = 0 and 0 × 0 = 0).

## usage example

```
and(5;2)
```

# arccos

Perfrom inverse cosine on the input number. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

The value will be retuned in the current angle system which can be
changed with the mode command.

## usage example

```
arccos(1)
```

# arcctg

Perfrom inverse cotangent on the input number. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

The value will be retuned in the current angle system which can be
changed with the mode command.

## usage example

```
arcctg(1)
```

# arctan

Perfrom inverse tangent on the input number. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

The value will be retuned in the current angle system which can be
changed with the mode command.

## usage example

```
arctan(1)
```

# arcsin

Perfrom inverse sine on the input number. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

The value will be retuned in the current angle system which can be
changed with the mode command.

## usage example

```
arcsin(1)
```
# not

Perform bitwise NOT on a number. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

The bitwise NOT, or complement, is a unary operation that performs logical 
negation on each bit, forming the ones' complement of the given binary value.
Bits that are 0 become 1, and those that are 1 become 0.

## usage example

```
not(5)
```

# or

Perform bitwise OR on two numbers. Works with regular and 
fraction numbers.

A bitwise OR is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length
and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding
bits. The result in each position is 0 if both bits are 0, while otherwise the 
result is 1.

## usage example

```
or(5;2)
```
